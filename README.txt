Other notes or comments to the grader:
In our ateam.zip, those 2019-*.csv files are data samples. These data samples are "small" data
samples provided by professor.  
screenshot_0.png shows the moment that the program is launched.
screenshot_1.png shows the moment that 2019-1.csv is loaded by the user.
screenshot_2.png shows the moment that the farm report of Farm 0, 2019 is generated by the user (after the user loads all 12 csv data files)
screenshot_3.png shows the moment that the farm report of Farm 0, 2019 is displaying on the program GUI. 

Future work: 
Currently, if the user want to read a data file, that file must be in the same folder as the program. 
Also, the output files of the program will also be in the same folder as the program.
In the future version(if we have), we plan to allow the user to open files in any directory of the 
computer, also allow the user to choose the directory of output file.
